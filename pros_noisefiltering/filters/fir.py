    """# FIR low-pass filter constructor.

    Here the filter is a simple LP FIR filter with the window
    method of /scipy.signal.firwin()/ function for a relatively
    stable output.

    Parameters:
    ===========
    numtaps_2 : int
        The order of the filter to be produced.

    FS : float
        The sampling frequency of the samples.

    cutoff_Hz : float
        cutoff freq in Hz.

    Returns:
    ========
    Filt : list
        A list of arrays containing the filtered signal
        with no delay (time delay of FIR filter: time_delay = 1/2(numtaps-1))

    Blank : list
        A list of arrays containing the filtered signal
        with time delay from FIR filter process.

    TIME : np.ndarray
        The `time interval` from the dataframe

    Usage example:
    ==============
    >>>filter_coeff, w, h = fir.lp_firwin
    >>>            (numtaps_2=20, FS=FS, cutoff_Hz=0.0001)

    """# Filtering a given array with FIR window method lp_firwin.

    In this function the signal is filtered and the time delay
    of the FIR filter is rejected through the warmup process.
    The warmup operation is used to eliminate the filters delay.
    The delay of the FIR filter is producing corrupted samples
    and the number of those samples are 1/2*(order-1).

    Args:
    =======
    coeff : np.ndarray
        The filter coefficients that will be used.

    order : int
        The order of the filter for the delay process

    FS : float
        The sampling frequency of the signal.

    Raw : list
        The list of arrays from the dataframe of raw signal

    Returns:
    ========
    Filt : list
        A list of arrays containing the filtered signal with no delay
        `time delay of FIR filter: time_delay= 1/2(numtaps-1)`

    Blank : list
        A list of arrays containing the filtered signal `with time delay`
        from FIR filter process.

    TIME : np.ndarray
        The time interval of the signal from the dataframe.

    TIME_NO_SHIFT : np.ndarray
        The time interval of the filtered signal with `no delay`.
